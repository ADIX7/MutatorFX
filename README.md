# MutatorFX

This repository contains work-in-progress code for framework functionality and is a candidate 
to be merged with the [QueryMutator](https://github.com/yugabe/QueryMutator) repo.

MutatorFX will contain the following, all to be published on [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/) 
for .NET based projects, source code based on .NET Standard:
- **Fluent Extensions**: for writing one-liners and shortening code.
- **FilterMutator**: Filtering by convention.
- **QueryMutator**: Object mapping by convention.

All MutatorFX packages will let you write much less code for the same effect, 
with a lot less room for developer error.
